## Blog's title linter for checking sentence case standard

`TitleCheck` checks if a given title follows the [Sentence case standard](https://www.scribbr.com/academic-writing/sentence-case/).

Write tests for checking the following scenarios:

- title follows the sentence case standard
- title follows the sentence case standard and includes one of the allowed words that are skipped from this check
- title doesn't follow the sentence case standard and has an allowed word
- title doesn't follow the sentence case standard
  - edge cases: semicolon, exclamation and question mark

Feel free to test any other scenarios that can you think of.
