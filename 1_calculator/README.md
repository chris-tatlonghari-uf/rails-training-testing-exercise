## Basic Arithmetic

Write tests for the `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` methods.
Ensure that edge cases are covered, such as division by zero.

## Factorial

Write tests for the `factorial` method.
Test edge cases, such as `factorial(0)` and `factorial(1)`.
Test for negative inputs to ensure the method raises the appropriate error.

## Error Handling:

Test that the `divide` method correctly raises an `ArgumentError` when dividing by zero.
Test that the `factorial` method correctly raises an `ArgumentError` for negative numbers.
